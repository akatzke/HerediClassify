* Clinvar Summary classifier
** Question
Currently only ClinVar entries that have no conflicting information or have been classified by three-star submitters is being reagrded
Additionally, when there are conflicting classifications then the classifications are also disregarded
This leads to a lot of information in ClinVar to be disregarded
** Criteria
This should include:
- Star rating of the submitter
- Time of the classification
Possible inclusions:
- Criteria given
- Which criteria specifically were given
** Outstanding questions and issues
* TODO Check out if it's actually possible to access the rules that were applied by the submitter
This will probably not be possible
Chat about that with Gunnar
** Evaluation
*** TODO Comparison of my appraoch to the simple mean approach
Currently the HerediVar database is "simply" making a mean of all available classifications and is using that at it's prediction
So the main comparison would be to that
But that is more of a procedural comparison
*** TODO Functional assessment of new score
The real question is how to functionally assess the classification
Which I'm not entirely sure is possible
Like how do you benchmark something like this?
Isn't this more something you would need the credibility and expertise of an expert commission to fuly accomplish?
** Possible implementations
Essentially go away from a mean to a weighted mean
The weight of each entry will be determined by the criteria mentioned above
For that purpose for star rating corresponds to a specific weighting of the entry
Last years in two year steps should be categorised and assigend a weight
*** TODO Weighting between star rating and years
Should these two be considered equally important or contribute at different rates to the weigth with which a classification is considered
